Changes the grid size of the 2x2 Nightvision goggles to 1x1.

Credit to [MrDoomah][] for the [original mod][] for 0.17,
and [kreeg][] for the [revived version][revived] for 0.18-1.1.

The revived mod appears abandoned and is no longer compatible with 2.0+,
and there appears to be no way to contact the author (discussions disabled on the mod).

In the spirit of its predecessors, this version will also be dedicated to the public domain.
